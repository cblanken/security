I'm Dennis the person behind Hopper's Roppers. This is the Roppers Security Fundamentals course. It combines theory and practical application, and combined with its sister course Roppers Technical Security Fundamentals provides the strongest base possible to become a security expert. These courses will teach students about risk, threat modeling, and how they can defend themselves and others online. This course is somewhat unique as I don't talk about \"hacking\" until the very end because all things considered, hackers do not present the greatest risk to the average person. We start by securing our physical presence and devices, move to passwords and authentication, learn just enough about network security, then finally move on to hacking and malware and all the other things. This course is about teaching practical skills backed up by theory; not advanced persistent threats and fighting off malware. It doesn't have an official place in the roadmap I use to guide students towards the best resources available, but it is an essential part of your development as a security professional. Pre-Requisites Our Computing Fundamentals course is recommended, but not required. This is not an extremely technical course, there is no requirement to know Linux or advanced networking.

As mentioned before, when people get hacked on the internet, they are incidental victims much more often than targeted. When a site is breached and the emails and passwords leak themselves onto the net, the next thing that happens is called password stuffing, where scripts will attempt to login to 1000s of sites using all of those email and password combos. If it works, you just lost your account. This means that reusing a password, no matter how \"strong\" it is, is only as secure as the least secure site that you use that password on. If they get breached, your password is out there on the internet, and if you used the same password for your email, you might be about to have a very bad day. So before we tackle the problem of password reuse, it's time for you to check if any of your accounts have been found in a publicly available data breach. If they have and your password was compromised, you should start changing anything that shares a password before someone else does, no matter how long ago in the past the breach may have occurred. Check out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ a badass website run by the good guys. Don't freak out too hard if you find your accounts have been breached, it's normal these days, but it's time to take steps to secure yourself. Password Manager My first recommendation is to start using a password manager such as LastPass, Keepass, or 1Password. Even Apple and Google have built-in ones for your browser these days. If you haven't heard of them before, what password managers do is recommend randomized passwords to you when you sign up to a site, store the password, and then autofill the password for you when you are logging in to the site the next time. This is very helpful because the human brain can only remember so many passwords, which leads us to reuse passwords across different sites. The problem with this is that if you use the same password on all of your accounts if someone steals that password at one site, they now have the ability to log into any of your accounts. Password managers help you maintain track of a bunch of strong, unique passwords, which limits the most likely threat that you have online. If you don't like trusting random internet people who tell you to download things in the first 5 minutes they know you, good call: I respect that. If you trust me, I recommend using LastPass (though it is paid now). There's plenty of other great password managers out there, but I've been using this one forever and that is the main reason I recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers. Again, I totally get if you don't want to do this now, just skip it. If you want to learn more about password managers, check this link out. If you take nothing else away from this course, just start using a password manager. It will make your life easier and you will be more secure.

A famous quote about the internet is “If a service is free, the product is you”. this applies from social media to news sites to free antivirus. Silicon Valley is built on advertising money, and they make their money by targeting advertisements. The more targeted, the more money they can charge. It isn't always advertisements though. Anything can be turned into a dataset from pictures of your face, your conversations, any behavioral feature, or things like what you buy and what malware you download. You probably have heard of cookies, but if you want a little bit more information,here's a link. If I had to guess, you probably have also heard you should be running an ad-blocker. If you still aren't and need some more convincing, check out this article. If you want to see what is tracking you right now on various sites, install the Ghostery extension. It's a pretty cool visual, and you can manually update permissions, however, it isn't a full adblocker. Your second task, if you do not already have one installed, is to install an ad-blocking extension. Ad-blockers do what they say they do, making your web experience more visually attractive and faster, but also block trackers and lessen the chance of getting malware-laden ads. For Chrome, I recommend uBlock Origin. I don't use Firefox, but it has an ad-blocker built-in which makes it one of the best choices for the privacy and security conscious. I also recommend installing Chrome and ad-blockers (or Firefox) on as many computers of friends and family that you do tech support for. Again, if you don't want to do this now, skip it. So now you've got adblockers installed, you're good right? Check out what someone can learn about you just from you visiting a website. http://www.whatsmyip.org/more-info-about-you/ I don't care much for VPNs because I don't care about ad tracking and I'm not in a country where I worry about my internet browsing being monitored and getting taken away by the secret police. You don't need a VPN for security no matter how many people are taking marketing money to sell them (use my code \"youdontneedavpn\" for 100% off!). As long as you are using HTTPS sites and not clicking through bad certificates, you shouldn't have to worry about getting your credit card or passwords stolen no matter how sketchy the public wifi you're on is. If you reeeally want one for privacy, I trust Nord VPN and use them when I'm in countries that annoy me by blocking random parts of the internet. Okay, so now you're behind a VPN and you have ad-block on. You're good now, right? Well, check out how well you can be uniquely fingerprinted just based on your browser. The EFF are the good guys, so they made this site to raise awareness. https://panopticlick.eff.org/tracker What's the answer here, other than that it is very hard not to be tracked on the internet? Keep building awareness, raising your level of security, keep your online personas compartmentalized, and know that the internet is probably not out to get you specifically, but that doesn't mean they aren't trying to take advantage of you.

The single best thing you can do for your computer, and all the computers you are in charge of is to turn on auto-update and forget about them. They are significantly more secure when they can receive updates on time. If your computer isn't updated, restart now and apply updates, this course can wait. While you're doing that, update all the computers you are responsible for. You're a tech person now so get ahead of your family members breaking their internet boxes. The same goes for browsers and other applications. We'll learn a bit more about exploits later in the course, but for now, just know that sometimes vulnerabilities can open up your computer to attack. By patching as soon as updates come out you can lower that window of vulnerability. You always like to assume you don't already have malware on your computer but if you are working off of a shared computer, there are no guarantees. First, ensure that Windows Defender is enabled. If it isn't, turn it on. Once again, do this on as many computers as you are responsible for. I don't really recommend adding 3rd party antivirus solutions these days because Defender is so good (notably Defender does not uninstall spamware or other programs that are annoying, just not malicious). If you believe that your computer has some sort of malware on it but Windows Defender isn't removing it, run MalwareBytes and see what if anything is detected. I'm a huge fan of their free product but don't leave it constantly running in the background. If MalwareBytes and Windows combined say you're good, you're probably good. No need to get paranoid.

CIA, in the context of information security, stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. They are known as the pillars of information security for good reason, as basically all security processes are designed around protecting one or more of these things. The foundational question of all security is \"How can I be sure that the CIA triad is preserved?\" However, I think that the CIANA acronym provides a little bit more context and is more useful for us. CIANA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-Repudiation, and Authentication. It's much less common (basically only taught in the military, but I think it is useful). Let's break them down. Confidentiality Confidentiality might be the one that springs to your mind first because we think of protecting information as so important to the field that we named ourselves after it: information security. Ensuring that data is kept secret is what this is all about. Integrity Something you might not have expected is integrity. This is the term we use to describe what it means to preserve the contents of data and ensure it has not been altered. By ensuring information isn't tampered with as it goes across the network or sits in a database, the modern world can trust the data presented to it. Availability It doesn't matter if the data is secret and not tampered with if nobody can access it. Providing availability is critical to ensuring that the world can benefit from the information. Now it is time for the optional ones. Non-Repudiation Alright, this one is weird, and a lot of people don't like it. But for me, this is useful because we can use it to explain some of the harder concepts that you'd have to stretch the other pillars to cover. Non-repudiation is simply the assurance that when an action is taken, it is possible to prove that the action was taken by that person. It combines the pillars of Authentication and Integrity into one concept. This is critical in things like digital signatures, forensics, and generally trust in other people around the internet. Authentication Authentication is where all of this comes together. Someone or something is allowed to look at data, and someone or something is allowed to alter the data. Authentication provides the means to determine who is allowed to look at and do what. Task: For each pillar, submit the word, the definition, and a way that it applies to your email account. This is a bit of a lengthy assignment, and don't worry about your responses being perfect, it's more of a thought exercise.

Risk is a somewhat quantifiable function of the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited and the impact it would cause the organization if the vulnerability is exploited. A common equation for risk is: Risk = Probability of Threat x Impact of Vulnerability or even more simply: Risk = Probability x Loss Let's define the rest of the equation. A threat is anything that has the potential to disrupt the normal functioning of an organization or in general cause harm to the organization. Determining the probability of a threat is a very difficult proposition. A vulnerability is a defect in a process, system, infrastructure, or procedure that can be exploited to cause harm to the organization by an external or internal actor. Identifying vulnerabilities is straightforward, but identifying the potential impact is even more difficult than trying to determine the probability of a threat. If you can identify the impact, you have the most important part of the equation locked down. Splitting out asset value helps us focus in on the importance of identifying impact, rather than getting focused on potential threats and vulnerabilities. Each decision you make can be based on this equation, and big decisions are actually a combination of hundreds of these risk equations. Then, based on what your acceptable level of risk is, you make your decisions. It is almost impossible to completely rid a system of risks without affecting its operability. There is always a constant battle to find the balance between security and functionality, and as the person who is managing risk, it is on them to determine the balance point. In a world of perfect security, availability falls to the wayside, and people who need information can't get it. Being a security professional means weighing the costs and benefits of risk. Briefly, ignoring the hundreds of frameworks and complex policy papers, the risk management process consists of the following general steps: As it is a cycle, after the feedback stage we can determine whether the mitigation that was put in place was effective and the cycle continues. Risk management is very complicated, but using a framework as a mental model is a good start. Answer these questions: What is a threat? What is a vulnerability? How do we define asset value?

I got lunch with the author once and he was a super good guy. Use this page from the good guys at the EFF to help assess what your risks are: https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks What do you want to protect? Who do you want to protect it from? How likely is it that you will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if you fail? How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those? For this exercise, our list of things we are trying to protect will be your email account and your phone's photos. For each, write down where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it. Do this on paper, not electronically. Think of three possible threat actors who might want to get a hold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation. As an important note, you are significantly more likely to be \"hacked\" by someone you know than some random internet stranger. This is even more likely to occur with significant others or parents who you may not normally consider adversaries. Think about what each adversary might want to do with your private data Think about what the likelihood of each adversary coming for that data Think about what happens to you if the adversary gets that data Now try to answer the question, how much trouble are you willing to go through in order to prevent loss. Think about if you had typed this information rather than written it on paper What would it take for a hostile entity to capture what you just wrote down if it was: On a piece of paper A local word document A google doc Now destroy the paper you just wrote on. Or don't. Decide how much risk you incur by keeping it. One important note is that you might not have anything worth a targeted attack personally, but you have access to other things that might be interesting to other people. For example, your contact lists can be used to identify other, more important targets. Even more dangerous, someone could use your account to send phishes to your contacts. A @navy.mil address is going to have a significantly higher click rate than some random @gmail. You also have access to your network, so someone could use you to pivot to a network you have access to. Submit any feedback you have on this threat modeling activity.

For many people, their greatest risk is their significant other or parents going through their devices, or worse, installing an app that allows remote access or tracking. Domestic violence enabled by technology is a very very real thing. There is a lot to say about this, but I'm not qualified, so I'll leave it to people like HackBlossom. After bosses, friends, partners, and relatives, the next most likely risk comes from their devices being stolen (or seized) by a third party, who then go through the data.

Incognito Mode: Does this prevent someone who is monitoring your internet connection, whether a network admin or your Internet Service Provider (ISP) from seeing what websites you are visiting? No. Does this prevent a forensics expert from determining which sites you've visited? No, but it makes it harder. Does this keep you from being tracked by advertisers? No, but it can help. Does this minimize your chances of being embarrassed by your search history and someone looking at your browsing history? Yes. There are use cases for Incognito mode but know its limitations. Messages Disappearing Messages Disappearing messages can allow you to have a safe default, where you can set the expiration of messages at a point in time in the future. This minimizes the total amount you could leak if your phone/email/chat account was compromised. Disappearing messages certainly aren't going to stop someone from saving a message if they want to, but they will make them less likely to be found and saved later, and that can fit your risk model. Encrypted Messages Just because a message is disappearing (cough Snapchat) or encrypted (Telegram's Default), that does not mean it is End to End (E2E) encrypted. E2E guarantees that messages can only be read by the intended recipients, so not even the server owners can read the contents. I personally recommend the Signal app for most needs. Signal takes this idea of E2E even farther and does not send Metadata to the servers. This means that even if they wanted to, they are not able to tell which of their users is talking to who, or when. This idea of minimizing metadata is huge. As mentioned earlier, if the product is free, the product is you, but in this case... not true! Signal is run by an absolute stud of a cyberpunk named Moxie Marlinspike, and he is the coolest hacker on earth. Read up on him a bit and be inspired. Full Disc Encryption (FDE) To go one step further, if your phone or computer is stolen and the contents aren't encrypted, even without the password it is fairly straightforward to just pull all the information from it. With full disc encryption, all data is encrypted at rest and has to be decrypted every time the device boots with a secret key. This means that if someone steals your device and tries to take the data off it they will not be able to, ensuring the confidentiality of your personal files. iPhones take this one step farther and encrypt the phone every time the lock screen is set, by default. This secure default has gone a long way towards making Apple the privacy and security company. If you are on Android, it is possible to enable FDE, but going to lock screen does not encrypt all contents, only shutting down the phone. For Windows, here is a decent guide: Microsoft Secure Boot and Encryption Overview. If you want to enable this, Google should point you in good directions. Encrypted Partitions / VMs If you are not worried about a technical threat, it is not a terrible idea to work from a VM and just turn it off every time you finish using it. There are a ton of ways that could go wrong, and you could always be instructed by whoever has control of you and the computer to turn it on and unlock it. Remember, if you are targeted and get hacked on the host computer, you get hacked in the VM as well. Keep that in mind. So what's the actually secure way to do things on a computer? The generally accepted answer is to mount an encrypted partition in your OS, and use that to hold a VM to do your important work on. If you are interested in this, here's a guide. That gives you some deniability, especially with the ability to make multiple partitions that unlock to different passwords, but it's not going to hold up particularly well in court, or to someone with a wrench. Tails and Other Risk Focused Operating Systems On the absolute farthest end of the spectrum are security-focused operating systems, which prioritize your data's safety over anything else, especially usability. Tails which runs off of a USB stick and when shutdown erases all the new data created, leaving no trace it was ever run. Think of it like a forensically secure incognito mode for your computer. If you still want to save files between reboots, there are other options, most notably Qubes-OS, that are specifically designed for secure computing. If you do all your work in Tails and you only use E2E encrypted messaging that disappears, you are probably pretty safe, and also pretty paranoid. But if your threat model actually requires Qubes or Tails, you shouldn't be getting advice from this website. To wrap up, minimize logs, minimize messages, minimize metadata. By applying these defaults you can minimize risk, even without requiring encryption or passwords, which are easily subverted in person.

Keep working on the mentality of this, understanding risks, their mitigations, and how it fits into individual and group risk tolerances. Think about the reasoning behind compartmentalization.

Password managers provide the ability to generate and store secure passwords across devices, all controlled by a single master password. This means you only need to know one password, and the rest can be pseudo-randomly generated. My first recommendation to students when they want to secure themselves now is to start using a password manager such as LastPass, Keepass, or 1Password. Even Apple and Google have built in ones for your browser these days. If you haven't heard of them before, what password managers do is recommend randomized passwords to you when you sign up to a site, store the password, and then autofill the password for you when you are logging into the site the next time. This is very helpful because the human brain can only remember so many passwords, which leads us to reuse passwords across different sites. The problem with this is that if you use the same password on all of your accounts, if someone steals that password at one site, they now have the ability to log into any of your accounts. Password managers help you maintain track of a bunch of strong, unique passwords, which limits the most likely threat that you have online. I recommend using LastPass. There's plenty of other great password managers out there, plenty of them really, Keepass is a great free one, but I've been using this one forever and that is the main reason I recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers. Again, I totally get if you don't want to do this now, just skip it.

Install a password manager if you haven't already Make your password for your password manager something you have never used before. Now that everything will be stored in the same location, you need to protect this as much as possible. My recommendation is to write this password down in a few places that you will not lose, but that will not be obviously related your password manager if someone finds it. Or just remember it. I recommend writing it down.

We discussed the idea of permissions earlier, where someone who is not authorized to read something is simply not granted access to it by a computer, but there are situations in which we need to send or otherwise expose sensitive data. To allow data to be exposed without authentication, we need a way to protect that sensitive information from people who don't know some sort of secret. This is where math comes in. There are two primary ways to protect the confidentiality of secret information: Encryption and hashing. Let's go into each a little bit, but we will focus on hashing here. Encryption Encryption is something you've definitely heard of before, it's the lock on HTTPS websites, it's what we are supposed to do with sensitive files before we send them via email, it's everywhere. Encryption, at it's fundamental level, is doing math and having some sort of shared secret between the sender and the receiver that any adversary who is listening in doesn't have, so the sender can encrypt and the receiver can decrypt, and the adversary doesn't know anything other than that a message got sent. There's a ton to learn about the study of encryption which is known as cryptography, and I have a giant section in my CTF course about it if you want to learn more. Encoding and Obfuscation One big giant step down from encryption is encoding and obfuscation. While they might look like encryption, they are really just ways of translating data into another form. While you might need to spend some time figuring out how it is obfuscated or encoded, there is no math involved so it is far from secret. Encoding is notably not always a security measure, and can be used to get data into an acceptable format for transfer. One common example is Base64 encoding, which can be used to convert a binary into printable ASCII text. Hashing Finally, we get to hashing, the star of this lesson. Hashing is what we use if we wanted to encrypt something so that it could never be decrypted again. What does that mean, you're probably thinking. Hashes are designed to be mathematically one way, meaning it is impossible to reverse a hash into the data that was used to create it. Hashing functions are algorithms that take in any data, do math on it, and output a string of some set length depending on the function, that can be assumed to be unique to whatever the input was. To put it another way, no two inputs should result in the same output hash (that doesn't mean it's impossible, and it's very interesting when it does, but that is outside the scope of this course). Let's play around with hashing to try and get an idea of what this means. One of the more famous hashing algorithms is md5, so we'll use the 'md5sum' utility that should be included on your Linux machine. Run this command, which takes the string \"password\" and gets the md5 hash of it. $ echo \"password\" | md5sum Now, run this command. $ echo \"password1\" | md5sum As you can see, the outputs are completely different. We can also use hashing on files and programs. $ md5sum /bin/ls This will give us the unique hash of the 'ls' program. If a single bit in the program changes, the hash will be completely different. This is used by many software companies when they distribute software to verify the integrity of their software, as it allows downloaders to verify the hash to make sure the file they received is not corrupted. So hashing is interesting and one way, but doesn't that mean everyone in the world who gets the md5 hash of \"password\" has the same value? Absolutely. For a fun check, google the hash of 'password' and you'll find that it is everywhere. What does that mean then, that we can't use the password \"password\" anymore because someone can view hashes, crack them using a dictionary of common words, and then use it to log in? Well you shouldn't use common words, but that's not actually much of a problem because of something known as salting. Salting Salting is a very cool technique where a computer or website creates a unique string to place at the end of every password entered.This means that they can leave their hashes publicly readable, but an attacker is going to have a much harder time cracking them. Let's demo this, as if we were a user setting their password for the first time on a system with hashing enabled. $ echo \"password&secretsalt1337\" | md5sum So here we are emulating as if the user entered their new password \"password\", the system added on a salt, in this case \"&secretsalt1337\", and then the system saves the salt and the output of the md5 hash. The original password entered will not be saved anywhere. Now the next time when you enter your password, it will be combined with the salt stored on file, hashed, and then the hash will be compared to the hash on file, not any stored password. We'll come back to this later, but it's 2021, there is no excuse to be storing someone else's password. /etc/shadow As we showed earlier, modern Linux versions don't store passwords in /etc/passwd. Instead, they have been moved to /etc/shadow. So now, guess we just have to cat /etc/shadow instead, right? If you have been paying attention to this course so far, you probably guessed that wouldn't work. If you check the permissions, in order to read /etc/passwd, we need root access. So now we try it with superuser privileges and we should see the results. There should be a bunch of entries, but let's break one down. dennis:$6$iU9KjTeD$5myyo4W7zppTOEdVUeP8/E6Kmjl7CtYYFqIIyes.fnNHy1fR0gJLb0q2KLhjAH6KrPpHZ0eJorBh.D74mq.vQ.:17952:0:99999:7::: Briefly read through the man page for \"shadow\" and see the breakdown: man shadow The most notable part of this is the password field, field #2. To break it out, we can see that it is represented by: :$6$iU9KjTeD$5myyo4W7zppTOEdVUeP8/E6Kmjl7CtYYFqIIyes.fnNHy1fR0gJLb0q2KLhjAH6KrPpHZ0eJorBh.D74mq.vQ.: Notably, you can't actually read the password! Let's break this field down ever further: $6 This represents the hashing mechanism we are using to generate the hash from this password $iU9KjTeD This represents the randomly generated salt used Remember how we were talking about salts earlier? In Linux, the salt is randomly generated for the user when they are created. These salts are different for each user. $5myyo4W7zppTOEdVUeP8... This is the resulting hash of taking the user's password and the randomly generated salt When a user types in a password, the OS takes the input, adds the salt that is saved in /etc/shadow, hashes the string, and then compares the output to the saved hash in /etc/shadow. If the hashes match, access is granted. So you might be asking, what is the salt for if an attacker can figure out what it is, and then run a dictionary of common passwords against it, to create a bunch of hashes, then compare those hashes to the hash saved in /etc/shadow? Well, the answer is that it is super inefficient to do that for every user. Without salts, attackers would only need one giant list of hashes to check against. With salts, for every user they need to run a new cracker against the hash. That is technically difficult and expensive enough that very few attackers will ever take the time to do that for your password. You're just not special enough, which is a good thing. Beyond this format, there are a few other characters that can be saved in an /etc/shadow password field. The use of \"!\" or \"*\" in this field indicates that the account cannot be logged into using a password, and must instead be logged into using an alternate method, such as an SSH key. This minimizes risk by forcing an attacker to know or have something besides a simple password. As a note, on modern Linux systems there are a variety of authentication methods (usually known as PAM) which use /etc/shadow in various ways. They are outside of the scope of this course, if you ever find yourself in a job that focuses on Linux auth, blame me for not teaching you more... and then teach yourself.

This will create a very very hard to figure out security question that you can easily use anywhere. To make it easier on yourself, maybe just take the first 10 characters from the hash. Or, if you are on a computer with your password manager, just write it down in your secure notes for a site. If they get your LastPass account you are not doing well anyway, so don't worry about it.

There are a varieties of ways to do that, but the most important bit is that we are able to trust the hops we are using, because a malicious hop is almost as bad as no hop at all. First, some vocab. Port forwarding = a network address translation technique where your router forwards incomming traffic to your computer, through a specific port. Proxy = an intermediary server between a packet's src and dst, designed to hide the ip of the src. Proxy chaining = connecting to multiple proxies betwwen src and dst. VPN = Virtual Private Network = a secure network connection between src and dst, operating as if there was a direct connection. TOR = The Onion Router = a network of nodes carrying traffic from the ToR browser, and encrypting traffic along the way. Designed to be a secure and anonymous web browser.

The critical thing to remember is that this extra hop added by the proxy, although it obfuscates your IP from the end target, does not hide it from the servers providing the proxy service. They can see all of your traffic and can do whatever they want with it. Your extra hops will create logs, and all those logs can still be used if someone gets them.

Network Penetration Tester (Pentester) It's like being an operator, but instead of hacking a target, you're paid to focus on a specific organization during what is a called a \"pentest\" to identify their assets, attack them, and write a report on your findings. It's like hacking, if you spent the entire time writing documentation. Physical Penetration Tester Like being a network pentester but you try to break into buildings, and usually it involves a lot of lying (which you call \"social engineering\" because you're a professional). Web Application Pentester It's like being a network pentester, but you look exclusively for vulnerabilities in webapps and attempt to prove impact. Then you write it up and give the exploits and bugs to whoever is paying you. If no one is paying you, then you can try to do the bug bounty thing and compete with everyone else on the internet. Tool Developer The people who build the tools required for operators and pentesters to do their jobs. For the most part, these people work for pentest companies and release their tools as content marketing for everyone else to use. And by everyone else, I mean criminals. Great marketing, you clowns. Exploit Developer The people who write exploits on various pieces of software and then distribute working exploits to operators, pentesters, and often the company or software project itself so they can fix the bugs. Blue This is where all the hard work is, where the free world is protected, and the money gets made. Yes, this is where the vast majority of the jobs are. Plus it's way more fun to work at the top of your field legally. Red teams just LARP being operators. SysAdmins, Helpdesk, and Network Engineers This is the front line of defense, and possibly the most important one. Anyone in these roles is in a security job, whether they want to or not. Security Engineer These are the people who attempt to architect the network, systems, and policies so that attackers have a harder time stealing everything. Security Analyst The people who look at logs and alerts and defend the network from attackers, 24/7. This is where most of the jobs are and what you should focus on. Incident Response (IR) These are the people who the security analysts call when they've detected a breach and need to respond to it. Digital Forensic Analyst Often combined with Incident Response in the acronym DFIR, these are the people the IR folks call when they need to find out what happened on a network at some point in the past. Malware Analyst These are the people who spend their time reverse engineering malware samples that the other analysts find. Threat Analyst / Threat Intel These are the people who provide actionable intelligence to everyone else on what the bad guys are doing. Auditing and Compliance/Governance and Policy These are the people who ensure that the security engineers are doing the right things Identity and Access Management These are the people who ensure that the right people are logging in to the right places securely. In a big company, this is absolutely critical. Secure Development While more of a subset of development, some developers are exclusively focused on making secure software, using specific processes, tools, and sometimes dedicated hardware. If every developer was an expert in secure development there'd be a lot less jobs for all the people listed above. Tool Developer The people who write the tools required for everyone else to do their jobs. Alright, hopefully I didn't piss anyone off too bad with this rundown. I'll be referencing these individuals as I go forward and talk about different common attacks.

But we have looked at our threat model before and have determined we are probably not a person of interest to the FSB, right? Right??? So according to our threat model, the most likely people to hack us will be random criminals who don't care who we are, they're just trying to get in. While it is an oversimplification, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\". If you are able to harden yourself ahead of time and not be an easy target, you will be much less likely to get hit with a non-targeted attack, and in the possibility that you ever are targeted, you will be more likely to not get caught off guard. These are some of the most common reasons you might get hacked. You are already hacked!! The most common way to get malware on your computer is to already have malware on your computer. Seriously, when I was first writing this section, I ran a scan on the shared family computer I was using and removed five separate PUPs and one piece of adware. Shared computers, whether family, work, or libraries, are hot places for malware to be sitting on, and if you log in to a owned computer, you might just lose your passwords to a keylogger. So let's make sure you are not owned already and then set ourselves up to be safe in the future. How Can You Tell Remember the term indicators of compromise (IOC) from before?. There are a ton that can be used, some approaches more technical than others. Common non-technical indicators include constant pop ups, home page redirection, search engine redirection, the classic pile of toolbars, and the computer being slow and the fans working way too hard. Technical indicators include extra processes running, network requests, and things saved in places they shouldn't be. Looking for these technical indicators is called \"Threat Hunting\". It deserves its own section, but we will briefly go over a few ways you can identify the bad things on your computer.

I disagree, mostly on the basis that while they only detect lowest hanging fruit malware, I don't want to be a lowest hanging fruit victim. Basically, these companies execute the malware, break down the malware into tiny pieces and creates indicators for the different components and what the execution of them look like, so that they can identify them on your computer and completely delete them off. I recommend that you have Windows Defender running at all times for protection. There is no need to have any other anti-virus on your computer, more is not better. As an important note, Linux anti-virus is pretty horrible and you should never install it. It's pretty difficult to get a virus on Linux, but if you do, let me know so I can RE it. The only time I'd recommend you run a second antivirus is to remove an active adware or PUP infection as Windows Defender doesn't consider many of them malicious. (If you want to correct me on this, just hit me via any of my many contact methods.) Task: Read this: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001738.htm Make sure Windows Defender is running, because it is built into your computer and is really, really good.

To avoid this, there is a proactive approach known as \"threat hunting\" where the defenders go out into their own network, look through logs, and try to find evil. As this is their network, they can do a lot of things to increase visibility, as well as force attackers to be loud and do distinctly attacker-ish actions. Perhaps most importantly, defenders have home team advantage and can check for changes and new happenings across their logs, which might alert them to bad things that are going on. Because they \"know normal\", it's easier for them to \"find evil\". People always say you should hunt with a threat in mind rather than \"boiling the ocean\", but both approaches have their benefits. We'll check them out as we go.

Alright so your computer is clean, probably, after following the last steps, now if you get infected in the future the most likely scenario is that you ran someone else's code and gave them access to your computer. There's nothing to feel bad about, this could have happened in many ways, and it happens to the best of us. Common ways this could have occured are online installers, phishing, and downloaded tools getting a malicious update. We will go over each method, and how to avoid it in the future. Downloading Nasty Stuff Downloading something nasty is the easiest way to do this, whether it is from an email, a big green download arrow on a website, or a program from a torrent site. Phishing is the most common, because it is the most targeted, which results in a higher install rate. We talked about this earlier in the Passwords section, so not much has changed, except the goal is for you to install a program or open a file, rather than type in credentials. Now what do you do if someone tries to phish you, or you are wondering if this is a phishing attempt? Read this: a href=\"https://decentsecurity.com/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"https://decentsecurity.com/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/ If you get a phish, good chance other people are getting it as well. So you need to report it! Make sure you know how to report to your organization to protect everyone else! You could have also run some backdoored file, whether from an online download, or packaged in with real software. A good move before downloading anything is run it through these sites listed in the anti-phishing tools. These sites are pretty awesome and use a lot of cool technology to make a determination if something is malicious. Attachment and file checkers use something called a \"sandbox\" to open the file/execute the program. The sandbox monitors the process created and looks for any malicious behavior, in addition to running anti-virus looking for a known bad. URL checkers use a browser to visit the URL and look for malicious behavior, like attempts at infection using an exploit. They also usually provide historical information about the website and if it has been used to host malware before. IP Checkers look at historical data for an IP address or block of IP addresses to see if they have been used for shady things in the past. Remember the difference between and IP and a URL? Tasks: Write a few sentences on why a URL could be clean historically but the IP address could be bad. This is going to require your understanding of hosting servers and domain names. Analyze a malicious attachment (https://github.com/heptastique/infected-pdf) using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it. This is an old, but very much live piece of malware. If you download this to a computer with active anti-virus, it will be blocked. I strongly recommend downloading it to Linux and not opening it up, even though your pdf reader is patched by this point. Just good habits. https://app.any.run/ https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload Hoppers Roppers 2024            Date： 2024-02-25 22:06:00 "},"SecuringYourself/1-HowtoHelpOthersBeSafeOnline.html":{"url":"SecuringYourself/1-HowtoHelpOthersBeSafeOnline.html","title":"How to Help Others Be Safe Online","keywords":"","body":"How to Help Others Be Safe Online If you are reading this you are likely to be the designated technical person in your friend group or family, and even if you're not yet, you're about to become it. This is a pretty huge amount of responsibility, being in charge of everything from printers to passwords to malware removal and phishing scams. You're probably pretty well prepared by this point! Here are some more resources you can use to help your friends, family, and especially less tech savvy folk be safe online and get to use the magical power of the interconnected world. Overall If you are in charge of a small fleet of family computers and other devices, save yourself time. Turn on auto-update on all of them, run Malwarebyte, and then turn on Windows Defender. Then give them a solid writeup on immediate troubleshooting actions for the wifi router and if there computer won't log in. With that going, you probably just cut your problems in half. The next step from there should be convincing everyone to use a password manager. By doing this you minimize the chances of them getting hit by password reuse, but more importantly they can't forget it so you have to help them through the password reset processes. Children If you have small children or are in charge of them, I definitely recommend placing some parental restrictions on their internet browsing and especially monitor who they are talking to. Eventually they'll want to have unrestricted access and you should give it to them, but only once you're confident they can make good (enough) decisions for themselves. For the most part, you'll really run into problems with kids downloading malware thinking that is a game/movie/tv show. I was guilty of this when I was younger, but I learned my lesson (and swore to take my revenge). The only time this is a problem is on shared family computers where your kids can get you infected. Just run anti-virus and attempt to convince them not to download and run random things, even if it gives them Robux. Parents and the Elderly This is where it gets critical. Instead of Robux, the elderly and other less tech savvy groups have money, and the bad guys know they are easy targets. There are many ways you can help protect them, but mostly it comes down to empowering them to think critically, while also helping them understand they shouldn't be embarrassed by anything. Ensure they know that they can always call or text you if they receive emails with an attachment or a weird link. By making sure they aren't embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, you can guarantee there will always be a dialog which can save you a ton of time down the road. They know about phishing for sure, but implement a rule with them that they should never give social security number, bank information, or credit card information over the phone, SMS, email, or to a website if the other side initiated the conversation. More conversations about phishing and scams, and importantly, treating them like adults who are trying their best is the way to go. Being the tech person is a hard job, but someone has to do it. Hopefully by now you feel ready to fill that role, now off to the rest of your security journey!
